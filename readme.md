# INTERACTIVE CIRCUIT PLAYGROUND GEODESIC DOME

    * which itself is a remix of[Adafruits **Circuit Playground Express Snap Fit Mount**](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3878226)
* The fantasic **Joinery: Joints for Laser Cut Assemblies** project for the joins between each triangle in the dome.

* Inkscape for drawing and modifing the triangles.

## Components
### Geodesic Dome
To create the geodesic dome I created triangles in Inkscape. The triangles need to be the exact dimensions in order to create the dome. The Domarama website was helpful to do the inital calculations. We are using a **2V** dome design.  
We used a brother ScanNCut to cut out the triangles. There are some solid ones and some with different pattern cutouts. Its fun to have a mixture.
You need 30x ABB, and 10x AAA triangles

### Circuit Playground Base
The circuit playground base is created with two 3d printed parts, some mesh fabric, copper tape, and conductive thread.
#### Bottom Plate (with fabric)
Wendy desgined this is TinkerCAD. Printed upside down to avoid support.  
It has a pause added a few mm after starting so the fabric can be added. Lay the fabric over the print, tape the sides to the bed, and resume the print. 

#### Top Plate (with circuit playground)
This is created by adding some shapes to the Circuit Playground Express Snap Fit Mount with Alligator Clip Cutouts model.  
This creates a secure hold for the Playground and a place for the geodesic dome to slot in.

## Assembly
### Dome
After cutting out 30xABB triangles and 10xAAA triangles, Carefully fold each of the tabs, make sure each triable is folded the same way. 
Then assembly them together following this image as a guide

### Circuit Playground Base
* Slot the 2 locating feet into the circuit playground holder and solt that onto the base plate with the fabric.  
* Cut 6 pieces of conductive thread and tie them around pins A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6. 
* Cut 6 pieces of copper tape and adhere them to the outside of the top plate **pinning a strand of conductive thread underneath it**. These will be our capactive buttons for interaction.

### Upload the code
Find the .uf2 file in the files folder and upload this to the circiut playground. 

### Finally,
Place the geodesic dome on top. Enjoy the lights and sounds as you touch the copper tape.
